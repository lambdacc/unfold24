## 4. Financial Hedging for Exporter in Vietnam Against Currency Fluctuations (2024)

I am from *VietTrade Exporters*, a medium-sized trading company in Vietnam that exports electronics to Europe. We are exposed to the volatility of the Vietnamese Dong (VND) against the Euro, which could impact our profits significantly. We wish to hedge against currency fluctuations by locking in an exchange rate, offering 30,000 SUI as collateral. If the exchange rate swings unfavorably for us, the risk pool will compensate for the financial loss, protecting our margins.

## 5. Operational Stability for Elderly Care NGO

We are *SilverCare Foundation*, a charitable institution providing elderly care services, including housing, healthcare, and daily support for senior citizens. Our foundation is heavily reliant on funding from donors and government grants. In the event of a sudden drop in funding or a donor’s withdrawal, we seek to hedge against operational instability by creating a risk pool. We offer 20,000 SUI as collateral to ensure that essential services can continue uninterrupted. Payouts will be triggered if funding falls below a specified threshold, ensuring that we can maintain our operations and continue supporting the elderly without disruption. In case funding remains strong, we are happy to distribute our collateral to well-wishers.
